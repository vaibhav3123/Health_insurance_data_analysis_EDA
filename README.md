# **Health Insurance Data Analysis üè•üìä**

## **Overview**  
In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a health insurance dataset. The project helped me enhance my skills in **Python**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** while providing insights into healthcare costs.

## **Key Findings**  
- **Age**: Older individuals (60+) exhibited higher insurance charges.
- **Smoking**: Smokers had significantly higher insurance costs.
- **BMI**: Higher BMI correlates with higher charges.
- **Region**: Insurance costs vary across regions, with the Southeast having higher charges.
- **Dependents**: Families with children tend to have higher charges.
- **Gender**: Males may face higher charges due to different health risk profiles.

## **Data Cleaning**  
- **Removed Duplicate Values**: Ensured that the dataset was unique by eliminating any repeated entries.
- **Handled Missing Values**: Processed any missing data and ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.

## **Tools & Techniques Used**  
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Visualization** with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**

## **Conclusion**  
This project provided valuable insights into healthcare costs and consumer behavior. It can be useful for **insurance companies**, **healthcare providers**, and **policymakers** to make informed decisions and enhance healthcare strategies.
