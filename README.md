Health Insurance Data Analysis üè•üìä

Overview

In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a health insurance dataset. The project helped me enhance my skills in Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib while providing insights into healthcare costs.


Key Findings


Age: Older individuals (60+) exhibited higher insurance charges.

Smoking: Smokers had significantly higher insurance costs.

BMI: Higher BMI correlates with higher charges.

Region: Insurance costs vary across regions, with the Southeast having higher charges.

Dependents: Families with children tend to have higher charges.

Gender: Males may face higher charges due to different health risk profiles.
